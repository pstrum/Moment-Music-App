# Moment Music App

Your *personal* music collection.

## The Problem

With so much music available in so many different places, we have massive music libraries that are difficult to navigate and lack sentimental value. How can I have a truly personal music collection? How can I create a digital-age [CD Logic Case](https://cdn3.static-tgdp.com/ui/productimages/approved/std.lang.all/72/32/277232_sized_544x500.jpg) that has all my favorite tracks and albums plus sentimental value?

## The Solution

Moment is a web application that stores all your special memories with the music you love. By tapping into Spotify's Web API, Moment allows users to bookmark music they enjoy in a journal format and navigate all their previous memories with music. 

Did a particular song or album make date night extra special? Or a road trip less long and boring? Create a moment in our app. As they build up, you'll create a truly personal collection of music. One which you can navigate by memories and not by the date you saved a track or alphabetical order.

Moment is where you go to create and navigate your personal music collection.
